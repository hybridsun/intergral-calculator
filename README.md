Most integrals aren't tractable by pen and paper, and a computerized solution approach is
both considerably simpler and far more powerful - you'll essentially treat all integrals
∫baf(x)dx∫abf(x)dx in 10 lines of computer code (!). Integration also demonstrates the
difference between exact mathematics by pen and paper and numerical mathematics on a
computer.
The latter approaches the result of the former without any worries about rounding errors due to
finite precision arithmetic’s in computers (in contrast to differentiation, where such errors
prevent us from getting a result as accurate as we desire on the computer).
A parser analyses the mathematical function. It transforms it into a form that's better
understandable by a computer, namely a tree (see figure below). In doing this, the Integral
Calculator has to respect the order of operations. A specialty in mathematical expressions is
that the multiplication sign is often overlooked sometimes, for instance we write "5x" rather
than "5*x". The Integral Calculator has got to detect these cases and insert the multiplication
sign.
While solving integration problems by hand you can sometimes mistake any formula or a value,
which can ultimately give you the wrong answer.
Or sometimes values may be interpreted or calculated incorrectly which can lead to deductions
in exams and test papers.
The integral solver on the other hand is free from any kind of error or miscalculations.
The cutting-edge algorithms incorporated in the step-by-step integration calculator helps to
receive highly accurate and error free solutions.
